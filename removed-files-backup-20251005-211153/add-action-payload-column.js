/**
 * Summary of the issue and solution:
 * 
 * Issue: The notifications table was missing an action_payload column that was 
 * referenced in the code, causing errors when creating notifications.
 * 
 * Solution: We've updated the notifications.js createNotification function to be 
 * resilient against a missing action_payload column. This approach is better than
 * trying to alter the database schema directly through the client API, which has
 * security restrictions.
 * 
 * Specific changes:
 * - Modified createNotification to only add action_payload to the insert object when it's provided
 * - This ensures the code works regardless of whether the column exists
 * - The column can be added later through proper database migration tools
 * 
 * Next steps:
 * 1. Try submitting a custody request in the TreasurerPage
 * 2. If needed, add the action_payload column using Supabase dashboard or SQL editor
 * 3. Consider creating a proper migration script using Supabase migration tools
