# Cash Custody Error Investigation

This document provides a systematic approach to investigate and fix the persistent error we're seeing:

```
Cash Custody API: Error in giveCashCustody: 
{code: '22P02', details: 'Token "cash_custody" is invalid.', hint: null, message: 'invalid input syntax for type json'}
```

## Understanding the Error

This error (`22P02`) is a PostgreSQL error code that indicates an invalid input syntax for a data type. The specific error about "Token 'cash_custody' is invalid" suggests that somewhere in the code, the string "cash_custody" is being interpreted as a JSON value, which is invalid.

## Current Status

We've made multiple attempts to fix this issue:

1. Added proper JSON validation and sanitization
2. Removed the action_payload field entirely from notifications
3. Skipped database operations to isolate the issue

## Troubleshooting Plan

### 1. Bypass Database Operations

We've temporarily modified the code to skip all database operations:
- Skip the actual insert into cash_custody table
- Skip wallet balance updates
- Skip notification creation

This will help us determine if the error is occurring directly in the giveCashCustody function or somewhere else.

### 2. Check Database Structure

The error might be due to database inconsistencies:
- Check if all tables mentioned in the code actually exist in the database
- Verify column types match what the code expects (especially JSONB fields)
- Look for any default values or triggers that might be causing issues

### 3. Check for Hidden JSON Issues

JSON-related errors can be subtle:
- Look for any fields that might be accidentally serialized as JSON strings
- Check for circular references in objects
- Verify proper handling of null/undefined values

### 4. Experiment with Raw SQL

If needed, we can try executing raw SQL statements to see if the issue is with the Supabase client or with the actual database:
```sql
INSERT INTO cash_custody (id, treasurer_id, cashier_id, wallet_id, currency_code, amount, is_returned, status)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), '...', '...', '...', 'USDT', 15, false, 'approved');
```

## Temporary Solution

For now, the code has been modified to work in "debug mode" by:
1. Skipping all database operations and returning mock data
2. Adding detailed logging to track execution flow
3. Commenting out problematic code sections

This will at least allow the user to see the flow working in the UI while we continue debugging the underlying issue.
