# Transaction Validation System

This document details the transaction validation system implemented for the Currency Exchange Manager application.

## Overview

The transaction validation system allows designated users (Dealings Executioners) to review and approve currency exchange transactions before they are finalized in the system. This adds an additional layer of security and compliance to the application.

## Features

- **Transaction Validation**: Dealings Executioners can validate transactions that require approval
- **Filtering**: Easily filter transactions by validation status
- **Detailed View**: View comprehensive transaction details before validation
- **Audit Trail**: System tracks who validated each transaction and when

## Database Structure

The transaction validation system adds the following fields to the `transactions` table:

- `needs_validation` (boolean): Indicates if a transaction requires validation
- `validated` (boolean): Indicates if the transaction has been validated
- `validated_at` (timestamp): Records when the transaction was validated
- `validated_by` (UUID): References the user who validated the transaction

## Usage

1. **Viewing Transactions**:
   - Log in as a Dealings Executioner
   - Navigate to the Dealings Executioner dashboard
   - View all transactions that need validation

2. **Validating Transactions**:
   - Review transaction details by clicking on a transaction
   - Validate legitimate transactions by clicking the "Validate" button
   - Rejected transactions remain in the pending state

3. **Filtering**:
   - Use the filter buttons to view All, Pending, or Validated transactions
   - Use the search field to find specific transactions by ID, amount, or currency

## Implementation

The validation system was implemented in migration file `006_transaction_validation.sql` which adds the necessary columns and indexes to the `transactions` table.

## How Transactions Are Flagged for Validation

Transactions are automatically flagged for validation based on specific criteria:
- High value transactions (amount > 10,000)
- Transactions involving certain currencies
- Transactions initiated by users with specific roles

Administrators can adjust these criteria as needed.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement multi-level approval for very high-value transactions
- Add email notifications when transactions need validation
- Create a more detailed audit log of validation activities
