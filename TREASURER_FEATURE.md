# Currency Exchange Manager - Treasurer Feature

## Overview

The Treasurer feature is a key component of the Currency Exchange Management system, enabling efficient cash custody management between treasurers and cashiers. This functionality allows treasurers to:

1. Distribute cash to cashiers for daily operations
2. Receive back unspent cash from cashiers
3. Track all custody transfers accurately
4. Monitor balances and custody status

## Features

### Cash Custody Management

- **Give Custody**: Assign cash amounts in various currencies to cashiers
- **Get Custody**: Record the return of cash from cashiers
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Handle any currency registered in the system
- **Balance Monitoring**: View real-time available balance and post-transaction projections
- **Notes & Documentation**: Add optional notes to custody transfers

### Security & Control

- **Role-based Access**: Only administrators and managers can access treasurer functions
- **Transaction Validation**: Checks for sufficient funds before allowing transfers
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All custody transfers are tracked and recorded

## Technical Implementation

The implementation consists of:

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - TreasurerPage.jsx: Main interface for custody management
   - TreasurerDemoPage.jsx: A demonstration version with mocked data

2. **Backend Services**:
   - cash_custody.js: API handling for all custody operations
   - Supabase integration for data persistence and synchronization

3. **Database Structure**:
   - cash_custody table: Stores all custody transfer records
   - References to users and wallets tables

## Using the Demo

For presentation and testing purposes, a demo version has been created that:

1. Uses mock data instead of actual database connections
2. Simulates API calls and responses
3. Provides visual feedback on actions
4. Updates UI dynamically to show the effect of operations
